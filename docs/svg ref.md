|  \<animate\>  |  Defines how an attribute of an element changes over time  |
| ---: | --- |
| attributeName= | the name of the target attribute |
| by= | a relative offset value |
| from= | the starting value |
| to= | the ending value |
| dur= | the duration |

| \<animateMotion\> |	Causes a referenced element to move along a motion path |
| ---: | --- |
| calcMode= | the interpolation mode for the animation. Can be 'discrete', 'linear', 'paced', 'spline' |
| path= | the motion path |
| keyPoints= | how far along the motion path the object shall move at the moment in time |
| rotate= | applies a rotation transformation |
| xlink:href= | an URI reference to the <path> element which defines the motion path |

| \<animateTransform\> | Animates a transformation attribute on a target element, thereby allowing animations to control translation, scaling, rotation and/or skewing |	
| ---: | --- |
| by= | a relative offset value |
| from= | the starting value |
| to= | the ending value |
| type= | the type of transformation which is to have its values change over time. Can be 'translate', 'scale', 'rotate', 'skewX', 'skewY'" |
