- If you are taking a driving test, you will need valid and current proof of automobile liability insurance.

## You will be administered: 

- A vision test 

- A written test 

- A skills test (driving test)
  

***NOTE: If you make an online appointment for the vision and written test you must make a separate appointment for the Skills (driving test)*** 

***NOTE: If you feel you are not ready for the skills test, you can get a Learner Permit after completing the vision test and written test. This will allow you to practice driving under the condition that a licensed operator who is age 21 or older, and who has had a license for at least two years, is in the front seat beside you.***

***If you are age 18 or older and you get a Learner Permit, you cannot take the skills test until a 30-day waiting period has passed.***
